> [16. 3Sum Closest](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest/)
>
> Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the sum is closest to a given number, target. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
>
>     For example, given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, and target = 1.
>     The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).

给定一个数组和一个目标数字，求和最接近目标数字的3个数字之和，同样假设有且只有一个满足条件的解。
